ALL
AS YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN MY POLICY OF IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS WHEN EVERY I FEEL IT IS NECESSARY.
I HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT TO BE TRULY IN COMMAND OF TIME MANAGEMENT YOU REALLY NEED TO USE A COMMANDLINE SOFTWARE SOLUTION.
AFTER GREAT EXPENSE AND THE SCRAPPING OF THE SYSTEM WE IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR IT WILL NOW BE COMPALSARY TO BEGIN USING THE DOGBERT DIARY
FOR ALL TIME ENTRIES THIS MONDAY. cATBERT director of human resources has informed me that anyone incorrectly
filling out their time sheets will not be paid. Dogbert IT informs me that you may use your existing usernames and passwords.

Regards

Dear valuable customer  

Your system is ready for payment. As requested and against my better judgement here are the usernames and passwords of all your minions
and users on the system. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS LIST.  

(case sensitive)  
User: dilbert Password: correcthorsebatterystaple  
User: alice Password: fistofdeath  
User: wally Password: 123  
User: asok Password: iheartmyjob  
User: pointyhairedboss Password: wordsbestboss  
User: catbert Password: yourefired  

With regards to your inability to log on again, it appears you have miss-spelt your password 'twice' during setup.
Unfortunately due to the importance of reverse coupling logarithmic integrations the system won't be live until Wednesday
and we have had to double the fee on password resets.

Mine sincerely  
Dogbert.  

P.S. No you can't just make a new user when you forget your password only Catbert “Evil director of HR” can create new users
